Medical /Clinical /Healthcare datasets and data sources that I find interesting

1. [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#healthcare) This is a large list of resources, largely american and global north datasets
2. [The WHO Global Health depository (Has an API)](https://www.who.int/data/gho/info/gho-odata-api) Lots of global south data
3. [CDC's health statistics repository](https://data.cdc.gov/browse?category=NCHS&sortBy=last_modified)
4. [KURIAS-ECG: a 12-lead electrocardiogram database with standardized diagnosis ontology](https://www.physionet.org/content/kurias-ecg/1.0/) The ontology is super useful
5. [Indian Government's public data repository has a ton of data, freely accessible](https://data.gov.in/catalogsv2?format=json&offset=0&limit=9&sort%5B_score%5D=desc&query=health&exact_match=0)
6. [Data.gov.in also has a bunch of sectorial catalogs  which collate all the datasets from a broad topic, health, social development, food etc. are relevant](https://data.gov.in/sectors)
7. The Integrated disease survellence projects puts out weekly reports of the [epidemic-potential disease outbreak investigation reports](https://idsp.nic.in/index4.php?lang=1&level=0&linkid=427&lid=3780). Sadly, these are in PDFS, but in [this notebook, I demonstrate how to extract and plot the data](https://github.com/aflip/IDSP)
